1) There is a data folder contain 3 folder
   => control_group
   => questions
   => test_group
   
2) There are 2 jupyter notebook file
   => DDM Assignment1 (contain EDA)
   => DDM Assignment2 (contain Model selection)
   
3) for every jupyter notebook you need to access the data which are avaible in data folder

4) keep in mind that you need to analyze data seperately because control group has different experiment and test group has different so 
   in the code file we analyzed them seperatly.
